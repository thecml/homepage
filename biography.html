    I am a PhD Student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University,
    Denmark. The focus of my PhD is survival analysis and time-to-event prediction for precision medicine.
    Previously, I received an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering
    and a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from Aarhus University.
    <br /><br />
    Before joining the PhD programme, I worked as a Research Assistant in 2020 on a signature project by the
    Danish government called <a href="https://projekter.au.dk/air" target="_blank">AIR</a>. Our goal was
    to leverage machine learning to identify elderly individuals who were at risk of falling. The AIR project
    became a success and expanded into <a href="https://www.aal-europe.eu/projects/precise/" target="_blank">PRECISE</a>
    in June 2022, funded by the European AAL programme. At the same time, I began pursuing a PhD in precision
    medicine at Aarhus University, focusing on survival analysis and time-to-event outcomes. As part of my PhD,
    I visited the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, Canada, from March to June 2024, where I was
    supervised by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rn7APGIAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Russ Greiner</a>.
    <br /><br />
    I have also worked as a Student Software Engineer at <a href="https://danskebank.dk/en/personal" target="_blank">Danske Bank</a>
    developing enterprise solutions for B2B customers, and later as a Machine Learning Engineer at  <a href="https://digirehab.us" target="_blank">DigiRehab A/S</a>.
