    I am a PhD Student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University,
    Denmark. My research is about survival analysis and time-to-event prediction, with a particular
    focus on handling censoring and modeling multiple events. Previously,
    I received an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering and a B.Sc. in ICT Engineering from Aarhus University.
    <br /><br />
    Before joining the PhD programme, I worked as a Research Assistant on a flagship project by the
    Danish government called <a href="https://projekter.au.dk/air" target="_blank">AIR, in Danish</a> that applied
    machine learning to prevent falls in community-dwelling elderly. In June 2022, the AIR project
    expanded into <a href="https://www.aal-europe.eu/projects/precise/" target="_blank">PRECISE</a> funded by the
    European AAL programme.
    
    Since June 2022, I have been pursuing a PhD in precision medicine a Aarhus University, focusing on survival analysis
    and time-to-event prediction. As part of my PhD, I visited the Department of Computing Science at the University
    of Alberta, Canada, from March to June 2024, where I was supervised by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rn7APGIAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Russ Greiner</a>.
    <br /><br />
    I have also worked as a Student Software Engineer at <a href="https://danskebank.dk/en/personal" target="_blank">Danske Bank</a>
    developing enterprise solutions for B2B customers, and later as a Machine Learning Engineer at  <a href="https://digirehab.us" target="_blank">DigiRehab A/S</a>.
