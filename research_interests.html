  My research interests are focused around survival analysis, specifically:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Competing risks/multi-event:</strong> Exploring how to design, implement and evaluate survival models that can predict multiple (sometimes competing) outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uncertainty estimation:</strong> Understanding how to compute, leverage, and communicate uncertainty in deep survival models, e.g., Bayesian and Conformal prediction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Censoring:</strong> Understanding censoring mechanisms in survival analysis, including dependent censoring, and developing methods to adjust for these effects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Applications:</strong> Investigating how survival analysis can be applied within healthcare (e.g., predicting functional decline in ALS patients)
      and outside (e.g., predicting remaining useful life in ball bearings).
    </li>
  </ul>
