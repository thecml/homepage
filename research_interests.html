  <li>
    <strong>Competing risks/multi-event:</strong> Exploring how to design, implement and evaluate survival models that can predict multiple (sometimes exclusive) outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Uncertainty estimation:</strong> Understanding how to compute, leverage, and communicate uncertainty in deep survival models, e.g., Bayesian and Conformal prediction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Applications:</strong> Investigating how survial analysis can be applied within healthcare (e.g., functional decline in ALS patients)
     and outside (e.g., remaining useful life prediction).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Developing new techniques to evaluate models under various kinds of censoring, e.g., dependent censoring, and to assess individual predictions.
